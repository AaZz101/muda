A library for **Mu**sical **D**ata **A**ugmentation.

**muda** package implements annotation-aware musical data augmentation, as described in
the [muda paper](http://bmcfee.github.io/papers/ismir2015_augmentation.pdf).

The goal of this package is to make it easy for practitioners to consistently apply
perturbations to annotated music data for the purpose of fitting statistical models.
